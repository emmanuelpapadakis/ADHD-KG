## Data and file structure

Employing semantic web technologies, we build a knowledge graph that integrates several data sources to produce a well structured network of knowledge that allows explration of various aspects of adult ADHD. The following table lists the contents of each folder in the [repository](https://github.com/emmanuelpapadakis/ADHD-KG) and explains how they are reflected as knowledge resources in the ADHD-KG.

| Folder name | Data Set | Format | Description |
| :----------- | :----------- | :-----------: | --- |
| CT | [Clinical Trials](https://clinicaltrials.gov/) | .n3 | A set of triples, formatted in RDF, that describe 660 medical studies that were conducted on adults with ADHD. Each study is described with numerous fields ranging from general data such as identifier, description, summary and keywords to study-specific information including disease being studied, associated interventions and drugs being used or links to external biomedical sources crucial for the study. |
| MeSH | [Medical Subject Headings](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/meshhome.html) | .nt | An extensive thesaurus of medical concepts. Triples are organized using Simple Knowledge Organization Standard (SKOS) to express hierarchical relation among concepts. |
| PubMed | [PubMed Publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) | .n3 | A set of 9537 publications in adult ADHD expressed as triples. Each resource is  detailed with basic information including title, authors, publishing venue and date, abstract, PubMed ID, digital object identifier and keywords |
| SIDER | [Side Effect Resource](http://sideeffects.embl.de/) | .n3 | A collection of recorded adverse effects caused by marketed drugs. It includes 1430 drug entries expressed as RDF triples, which include information about naming of drugs, adverse reactions, their recorded frequency and classification, after [MeDdra](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378608009031602) |
| SemanticAnnotations | Custom generated | .n3 | Links between free text and medical concepts|
| DrugBank | DrugBank


Several knowledge resources are combined together to compose the ADHD-KG. Each Folter in the repository represents one of those knowledge resources
